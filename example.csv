1138680045,Types of co-ops,,Co-ops are found everywhere and together they contribute billions to the UK economy every year. Learn more about the different types of co-ops and who owns them.,https://www.uk.coop/understanding-co-ops/what-co-operative/types-co-ops,,2025-06-05T07:41:15.828Z,https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/styles/og_facebook/public/2020-10/2017_TRADESTREET_01_0.jpg?h=fcfa88c0&itok=jE16-Ix2,"Highlight:In a worker co-op, the co-op is run for the benefit of - you guessed it – people who do the work. Worker co-ops like Leeds Bread Co-op, Delta-T Devices and Creative Coop are democratically owned and collectively controlled by the workers, who all participate in decision making.

Highlight:These types of co-ops tend to have very flat structures and no hierarchy – some even pay all the staff equally no matter what their role.

Highlight:Producers or suppliers may come together to form a co-op to get a better deal for their products. A good example of this are farmer-owned agricultural co-ops, who work together to share resources and use their collective bargaining power

Highlight:Credit unions like The Co-op Credit Union are good examples of customer owned organisations. They exist to serve the needs of their members, which in this case is access to affordable finance.

Highlight:Community owned businesses can be co-ops and raise finance through community shares. People invest often small sums of money and become co-owners of vital local enterprises – from pools to pubs, community housing to heritage buildings. No matter how much you invest it's one member, one vote, so everyone has a stake and a say in how the organisation is run for the benefit of the community.

Highlight:Multi-stakeholder means a combination of members own and control the co-operative business.  So this might mean a housing co-op with residents and workers making decisions together. Or a multi-million pound retail co-operative where members are elected to have a say to represent customers and the communities where they operate.",false.js
